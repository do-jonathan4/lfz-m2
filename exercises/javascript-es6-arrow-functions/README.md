# javascript-es6-arrow-functions

In this exercise you are going to convert a pre-made file's ES5 function definitions to ES6 arrow functions where it is necessary.


### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise

1. Read about `arrow functions` in sections 13.1 - 13.4 and 13.8 [here](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_arrow-functions.html).

1. Take a look at the provided `index.html` file.

1. In this file is the (mostly completed) code to make it possible to tell Flash a joke! Here is what it will look like when you get it working:

</p>

1. Currently however, if you open the page and try to use the form, it does not work as intended. Throughout the code for this exercise, there are only ES5 functions currently, but this code can be made to work if some of these functions are converted to ES6 arrow functions.
    - ***NOTE:*** Not all functions will need to be converted. Make sure you consider _why_ a function would need to be refactored into an arrow function, rather than simply converting them at random.

1. Refactor the code so that the right type of function definition is being used for each function definition, and test your work. When you can successfully tell Flash a joke and get a response, you have completed the exercise!

### Submitting Your Solution

### Quiz

- How does an ES6 arrow function differ from an ES5 function?
- When an arrow function's code block is left without curly braces, what (if anything) changes in its functionality?
- In what situations would you possibly use an arrow function?
- In what situations would you **not** want to use an arrow function?
