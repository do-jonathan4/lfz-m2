### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (**from master**) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md).

### Exercise

1. Read about `const` and `let` [here](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_variables-assignment.html).


1. Take a look at the provided `index.html` file.

1. Convert all the variables to `const` and `let`.  Make sure to use `const` and `let` appropriately.  Anything that can be a constant variable, should be a constant variable.  Feel free to move variables around or add extra if needed.

1. When turning in your work, make sure to refresh the page enough times to get to the `konichiwa! is a japanese greeting.` log to the console.
