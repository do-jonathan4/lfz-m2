Environment Setup

In order to keep the process simple for staff to keep track of students we have specific guidelines
in setting up Github and Slack properly.

### Setting up Github

By now you have a github account that is associated with LearningFuze.
We have specific requirements for each of our students' Githubs and there is a
strong possibility your Github already meets the requirements.  If it does not
meet the requirement please change it by following the directions below, and if
it does feel free to move to the next requirement.

### Github Username
For example, let's say your name is "Mike Jenkins".
The following examples are acceptable usernames for someone with that name:

  - `mike-jenkins`
  - `mikejenkins22`
  - `mike_jenkins2019`

The following examples are usernames that are not so great:

  - `mixMasterMike`
  - `itsyaboimike`
  - `kittybittymeowmeow`

To change your username please follow the following directions:

1. After logging in, go to settings. <br/>

1. Click Account. <br/>

1. Change Username. <br/>

    ![third step](/assets/github/github3.png)



It's safe to ignore the warning you get after clicking Change Username.

Once you have completed changing your username, please notify an instructor
via Slack so we may update our records.


### Slack Setup

This step is fairly simple.  We need an image to get to know you quicker.  Please refrain from using profile pictures that could confuse us when we are answering questions.  We all love memes but to make the process work properly, we need our students to have a profile picture that will help us identify them.


One out of three images below are acceptable:

  ![first image](/assets/slack/slack1.jpg)
  ![second image](/assets/slack/slack2.png)
  ![third image](/assets/slack/slack3.jpg)


Of course they do not need to be professionally taken.  We just need to know what you look like.

To change your slack picture follow the directions below:

 1. Click your username on the top left and click `Profile & Account`

  ![first step](/assets/slack/slack4.png)

 1. Click edit profile

  ![second step](/assets/slack/slack5.jpg)

 1. Upload your new photo


  ![third step](/assets/slack/slack6.jpg)





### Done!
